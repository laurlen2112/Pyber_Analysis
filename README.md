# Module 5: PyBer Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis

## *Purpose*
The purpose of this project is to create a summary data frame organizing ride-share data by city type and to create a multiline plot showing weekly fares per city type.

## *Results*
The PyBer summary data frame shows: [pic]

The urban city type category holds the largest accumulated ride total, the largest number of drivers, and the largest total fares.  Despite those metrics, the urban city type posts the lowest average fare per ride at $24.53 and the lowest average fare for per driver at $16.57.  

By contrast, the rural city type posts the lowest ride totals, lowest number of drivers and lowest fare totals; however, its average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the highest of the three city type categories.  

While suburban category falls in between the urban and rural types, it is noteworthy that its average fare per driver, $39.50, is double the amount of the urban type's average fare per driver.  Likewise the suburban type's average fare per ride is higher than the urban type's average fare and about $4.00 lower than the rural city type's average fare per ride.
 


# *Summary*

Based on this analysis, it is recommended that PyBer invest resources in growing its suburban city type market share because its average fare per ride is more lucrative than the urban city type.  Although the rural city type posts the largest average fare, it may not be worth focusing resources toward that type since population density tends to be less meaning there are less riders and less drivers in rural city types.  While the urban type posts the largest total rides and fares, those metrics are likely due to the higher population density in urban city types.
